                We are fortunate that much of the groundwork for the study of
                genocide in Asia Minor has been done by Armenian scholars with
                whom we share common experiences in place and in time. It is
                their pioneering work, particularly since the last four decades,
                that has paved the way for a better understanding of what
                happened, how it happened and why these monstrous acts of
                inhumanity took place in Anatolia during World War 1 and its
                aftermath. Undoubtedly, the study of genocide world wide derives
                its impulse from the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Nazi
                Germany and by the United Nations active involvement in genocide
                prevention. An area completely ignored by its predecessor the
                League of Nations.

                Moreover, the survivors of the Greek genocide who came to Greece
                or went to the diaspora had been so profoundly traumatized by
                their experiences (the suicide rate in the first year upon their
                arrival in Greece was more than twice the rate of the native
                population) and so completely involved with the task of mere
                survival that their story was delayed for an inordinate period
                of time. This silence was reinforced by the Greek
                Governments&#8217; desire not to compromise its relationship
                with its Turkish neighbor. Moreover, the international community
                was in a denial mode. Finally, a significant portion of the
                intellectual elite of Pontic Hellenism had been exterminated in
                the death marches and in the Kemalist&#8217; prisons of Amasia.

                Turks to acknowledge genocide, but all of it stopped. There are
                no official trials on the Pontian side. In 1921, it was obvious
                and clear what happened in Pontus because it was reported by
                allies of Turkey (the Frunze diary). Initially, he was against
                the Greeks, but he ended up calling for the atrocities to stop.

                In spring of 1922, British and American missionaries published
                what happened in Pontos. The Western powers said a commission
                should be formed and then argued about who should pay for it. In
                the end, the League did not go far because the Turks limited
                inquiries to western Anatolia, where there were minor atrocities
                compared to Pontus. The Turks insisted no one go to Pontus.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                The Commission of Inquiry never took place because the Turks
                would not come to the peace table at Lausanne. The Turks needed
                to give permission for the return of Turks from Greece. If
                Greece expelled the Turks, resettling refugee Greeks could fail.

                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>:  Prof. Stavrou told us history
                is not a fact until someone writes about it. The Zoryan
                Institute was formed in 1982 because documentation was
                important. What are the archival sources for Greek history?
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Memoirs and published histories
                are secondary sources because they have no footnotes, but they
                constitute 95% of history. In fact, some have documentation, but
                sources are not cited for Pontos histories, or the footnotes
                shown are too general.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Any fact cited must be
                verifiable, or it won’t be accepted.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: There are excellent archives in
                Athens, at the Center for Asia Minor Studies. The 1908–1922
                period has so many dimensions, including documents in Russia,
                personal archives of Greeks of the diaspora, and personal
                libraries of Greeks that are not public and unavailable to
                scholars until they are bequeathed to a public institution.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                There is information—how do you identify and preserve it so it
                is accessible by scholars who can document what is said?

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: There are many sources for the
                early lives of Pontian immigrants in the U.S. Since all men
                registered for the draft, lots of information was collected on
                them, such as date of birth, place of birth, where they lived,
                etc. Other sources include naturalization papers, census
                information, church records, and city directories. There are
                newspaper articles about what was going on in the Pontian
                community. There are ship manifests that tell who the person
                came to visit, their relationship, and who was left behind.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: The U.S. government was involved
                with the Ottoman Empire, so there is a wealth of information:
                diplomatic correspondence for the U.S., Great Britain, France,
                Germany; Russian and Ottoman archives. These are good sources
                that provide lots of work for many generations of scholars.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Students need to have the
                languages—it is best to know 4 to 5 languages. The archives will
                be written in 15–20 languages. There exists a catalog of names
                and maps of areas to be exterminated. This provides intent on
                the part of the Turks and is part of the debate on denying
                genocide.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                We need to train people in the languages they need to do the
                research so the story can be told in all its complexity.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Consider the physical nature of
                the documents. Many are handwritten paper documents located in
                other countries. One can take photos of them or scan them and
                post them on the Internet.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: When you write articles, include
                as much of the original document as possible in the body of the
                paper. This is another way of getting original information to
                more and more people.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: There is a lifetime of work for
                scholars. When language ability is limited or at the
                undergraduate level, original scholarship can be done using
                public works, for example. Photos are very important—scan them
                and find information about them while people are still available
                who can do this. For unidentified photos, put them on website
                for a wider audience of people to see and provide
                identification.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Photographic evidence is doubly
                powerful. There are many ways of identifying photos, such as by
                the background curtain used in a certain studio, or other
                identifying marks.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: Hold photo parties. Bring copies
                of old photos and invite people to identify them.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Owners often don’t want to part
                with photos until it is too late. Children will clean out a
                collection and toss old photos if they don’t know the people.
                Sometimes photo libraries are brought in but they may be only
                partial collections. We need to save entire collections—get
                owners to promise to donate the library but let them hold onto
                them until they are ready to part with them.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                It is important when preserving material to notify the community
                and make a master catalog of what’s available.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: Ask for old 78 rpm records. Make
                copies and keep a collection of Pontian music.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Professor Phufas</strong>: Look to other visuals, not
                just books. There are Pontian Greek and Asia Minor Greek
                families who have websites. Some have Web pages with photos and
                stories. Link to these sites through an online portal. Use

                Research is essential. Scholars have obligations when publishing
                to make sure their work is original. This is a painstaking
                process that can take years, but there is a power to academic
                research. A publication documenting the German role in the
                Armenian genocide helped lead to its recognition in Germany, but
                it took 8 years of research and preparation. What does it take
                to interest a person to do research?

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Most of the scholars are with
                the university, but some aren’t. If we attempted to
                institutionalize the archives, they may not have been accepted
                because the Armenian genocide is so politicized. What is the
                status of the Pontian Genocide?

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: There is ongoing publishing in
                Greek, and several people make a living as Pontian scholars in
                Greece. Some of it has been translated into English. The problem
                is there is a lot of material that is just straight descriptive
                and not analytical.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                We have to rely on Greece to do the work because they get paid
                for it. No one can make a living at it here. It is disappointing
                there are no young scholars.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Most work being done is not
                analytical. In reading Fotiadis’ work, he was really impressed
                by the amount of productivity. All this is unknown outside
                Greece, because Greek scholars are not comfortable with English.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                It is encouraging that a few young scholars are getting degrees
                in the U.S. He would like to see a course in 20th century
                Europe, with emphasis on the Asia Minor disaster.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Zoryan has commissioned research
                from scholars. Discuss subjects that need to be addressed. What
                is the feasibility of a major translation program?
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Translation is so important
                because so many documents and works of fiction, memoirs, and
                first-person narratives are in Greek. These works are fabulous,
                emotionally touching, and have great interest beyond the Greek
                community.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Translating Asia Minor Greek from the 1920s into English that is
                readable by an American audience requires a special translator.
                Translating academic Greek into English is also a specialty.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                It will take hundreds of hours of research to figure out what
                some works mean—for example, some Turkish is written using some
                Greek characters. Greek of a particular era is not easily
                translated into English of another era. Making it accessible in
                another language means not a literal translation, but rather
                must be interpreted translations that don’t lose the beauty of
                the original, the essence of the work.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Narratives of people who came through the suffering need to be
                translated into English. These are moving memoirs. Why aren’t
                more of them translated?
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Many first-person experiences haven’t been written yet. These
                are important for posterity.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: This is the kind of rich
                literature that, if translated, would make a strong impact as
                antiwar literature.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                Most Greek literature is not as accessible as it should be.
                There is a project in Greece to publish about 50 works of modern
                Greek literature and to translate them into several languages.
                Two are now completed.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                If the entire program of 50 is completed, it will make a good
                resource for teachers.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">
                In addition to translations of individual works, an anthology of
                several works of Asia Minor history would get an audience. This
                will lift Greek literature to modern European standards.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                <strong>Dr. Smonides</strong>: The central issue is how to get
                scholarly works from the native language into English. We must
                cultivate more from scholars because now there is nothing to
                read.

                The Japanese put lots of effort and money into translating and
                making literature available to students to become the next
                generation of scholars. They published the works by bringing in
                professional translators but the end result was worthless. The
                best way is work with scholars who select works and translate
                them to make them accessible to English speakers. These were
                valuable and useful. The responsibility falls on the Greek
