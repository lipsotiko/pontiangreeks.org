        <strong>A Woman from Kerasounda Recalls</strong>
        | Μία Κερασουντία Θυμάται
      </p>
      <p>As narrated by Eleni Leontidou (June 10, 1997)</p>
      <p>
        But when the refugees arrived in Greece after the population exchange,
        naked and barefoot, they started working in order to regain a little
        semblance of life. But the wounds within them remained untreated. The
        memories of forced exile turned into nightmares. Nightmares that would
        cut short their breath and tear up their hearts. Wounds that remained
        permanent which pained them during the whole duration of their lives and
        would bleed at the slightest prick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such are the circumstances of the woman from Kerasounda. It matters not
        what her name is. Since just like her there were hundreds of mothers who
        paid with their very lives for the barbarities committed by the Turks
        along with their German instigators and in the interests of the Great
        Powers. The history of that well known, hazel-nut producing seaside city
        of Pontus &#8211; the beautiful white washed Kerasounda &#8211; is well
        known to the Pontian Greeks. Blessed with wealth, comforts, and
        fine-looking homes, the inhabitants were well-heeled and content, and
        showed concern for their fellow townspeople and their homeland. However,
        the blood-dripping Topal Osman and the Turks rampaged through this land.
        They devastated the land throughout the years from 1916 to the
        population exchange in 1923.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those inhabitants who were not butchered were hanged and tortured and
        deported. Memories of horror whose pain still remains to this day.
        During the initial years of the refugee migration to Mother Greece,
        those surviving women along with their children did whatever kind of
        work they could to stay alive. So it happened one day in Kallithea
        (Athens district), a woman of Kerasounda went to the home of Mrs. Eleni
        Leontidou to stitch some quilts. After some chatting, the subject turned
        to the never-to-be-forgotten homeland. The lady from Kerasounda of the
        quilts as if in a trance, unfettered herself and spoke of her anguish.
        The day had come when along with others in her family, they were to be
        forcefully exiled. And until quite recently she had been a contented
        mother with two small children and one on the way. So, she took to the
        road of exile. Pregnant, with a child growing inside her, another infant
        in her arms, which in order to protect she had wrapped in a “post”
        (sheepskin), and another little one tugging at her apron.
      </p>
      <p>
        The barbaric Turks with their plans of total annihilation of the Greek
        people selected the middle of winter to expel these people in order to
        be certain that no one would survive. The woman from Kerasounda
        continued on with difficulty, her spirit choking her to death. The Turk
        irregular soldiers shoved the women, beat them, swore at them, ridiculed
        them. In her exhausted state, woman sagged and fell. The Turkish
        irregular soldier caught up to her and started shoving her. The wretched
        woman did not have many options. She turned and looked around and saw a
        Turkish village nearby. Her spirits rose. She would leave her small
        infant wrapped in the sheepskin in the hopes that some merciful Turk
        would come by and would take it. If only her own flesh and blood could
        survive. If only this unfortunate God&#8217;s creature could survive. So
        with these thoughts, she left just it as it was wrapped and followed the
        flock of exiles with the hope that a merciful hand would gather it up.
        She had no other option. The Turkish irregular soldier cursed,
        threatened, forced. They had hardly distanced themselves and her gaze
        continuously turned toward the rear. Oh Lord what horror! Cries and
        yelps and howls for a moment had merged. Instead of a merciful Turk, the
        infant was snatched by wild dogs tearing it apart. Her soul grew
        desolate and all the while the wild Turk soldier was pushing, cursing
        and threatening her to keep moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what the woman of Kerasounda told to Mrs. Eleni Leontidou,
        choking on her tears at the horror of the image of her flesh and blood
        torn apart. What civilized human being can endure such an image? And
        yes, Turks were able to, and are able to do it. Their goal was, after
        all, the extermination of the Greeks of Pontus.

      <p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
      <p>
        These writings are dedicated to the memories of the women and innocent
        children who were lost on the trails of forced exile from 1914 to 1923,
        whereupon the tragedy of the Greeks in Pontus came to an end. Following
        the population exchange, this ruined and crushed humanity arrived in
        their new homeland, where according to our poet Ilias Tsirkinidis: “They
        were left without foundation in a strange land.” In other words, these
        Greeks arrived in Greece as strangers in a strange land; as first
        generation refugees. And here too, the women rolled up their sleeves and
        rose to the challenge of reconstituting their families and
        re-establishing their lives.
