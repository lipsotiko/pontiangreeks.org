        From the stories of George Andreadis<br />
        Stories of Orthodox Greeks who, appearing as Ottoman Muslims, kept their
        faith alive through two centuries of catacomb existence.

      <p>
        For centuries, Pontus was isolated by its 700-mile chain of towering
        peaks and river-fed chasms, threaded with narrow muddy tracks on which,
        even now, it is easy to lose one&#8217;s way in the dense forests of
        black pine and impen¬etrable alpine mist. As if approaching an island,
        visitors sailed to Pontus over the Black Sea rather than attempt the
        unyielding peaks from the south. Beyond the torturous summit of the
        Zagara pass, and several days journey by pack animals from Trebizond,
        the barren low-lying mining region of Kromni was an isolated refuge for
        crypto-Christians. Eagles and vultures, wild boar, deer, bears and
        wolves, all made their homes there.

      <p>
        Although some Greeks remained openly Christian, burdensome taxes and
        discrimination caused many to convert to Islam and their children today
        are Turkish Muslims. Another large group said, &#8220;No, we will keep
        our reli¬gion, but how will we survive? How can we save our lives and
        the honor of our daughters?&#8221; In the end, they became secret
        Christians.<br />
        Although denying Christ, even outwardly, is a sin for a Christian,
        during these times when many civic leaders, the educated, and wealthy
        turned to Islam, how could illiterate and primitive mountain people be
        held account¬able? In many cases the Eastern Christian Church accepted
        the solution of crypto-Christianity so as to withstand the waves of
        voluntary and compul¬sory Islamization that were leaving churches empty
        of believers.

        <strong>Elena Lazaridou</strong> &#8211; The Last Greek of Trebizond
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not widely known, but at the Exchange of Populations, not all of
        the Greeks left Pontus. A small number had Russian citizenship, and
        because Turkey did not want to stir up problems with Russia, they
        allowed them to stay. Most left voluntarily for Greece by 1936, when it
        became clear that there was no future for them in Trebizond (now Turkish
        Trabzon). The last old Greek woman, Elena Lazaridou, a Kromnian with
        Russian citizen¬ship, died in Trabzon in 1965 at age 90, and was buried
        by the Catholic priest of Santa Maria Church.<br />
        Eleni had a daughter, Parthenope, who, at the time of the Russian
        Revolution, became a fervent communist, believing that even the family
        property left by her father was profit gained from the &#8220;blood and
        sweat of simple workers.&#8221; She disappeared behind the Russian
        border to live a &#8220;truly socialist life,&#8221; emerging in Greece
        in 1958, forty years later &#8211; still a staunch communist.
        Discovering that her mother still lived, Parthenope traveled to Trabzon,
        where she spent three years trying to convince Eleni to move with her
        back to Greece. The old woman adamantly refused, &#8220;I was born here
        and I&#8217;ll die here&#8221; &#8211; and she did die there, cared for
        in old age by Turkish Muslim neighbors, whose children had grown up
        hearing Eleni&#8217;s stories of their distant Christian origins. At her
        death, the youngest son of the Turkish family even traveled to
        Thessalonica to try to convince Parthenope to claim her mother&#8217;s
        property but, a socialist to the end, she refused the inheritance.
        Parthenope spent her last years in Thessalonica, earning her daily bread
        cleaning onions in a meat processing workshop. She tragically ended her
        own life by throwing herself under the wheels of a truck.<br />
        In 1960, however, while still living with her mother in Trabzon,
        Parthenope wrote a moving letter to Mr. Georgios Papagavriel of
        Thessalonica about her visit to her Kromni home on horseback. In the
        sixties, all of the inhabited villages of the region were filled with
        Pontic-speaking Muslim Turks who warmly remembered their former Greek
        neighbors, and Parthenope was welcomed with Pontian food, music, and
        dances. Village elders offered their homes for the night, and once she
        even slept in the house in Kotsanton that had belonged to her
        great-grandfather. Although a communist, she had a warm love for her
        homeland. Here are parts of her letter:
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the villagers came to see us off. It was a cold morning and in a
        little while it began snowing. As we were on horseback, we became very
        wet, but, thank God, the snow stopped as we ascended the moun¬tain and a
        fine warm sun began to shine that dried us out. Seeing all of the
        villages covered with a blanket of white snow, and those ruined churches
        without a priest, without pilgrims, on every hilltop, I could not stop
        my tears. How deeply they touch your heart and soul&#8230;.
      </p>
      <p>
        My deepest impression in Imera was when I walked through the village.
        The church is still standing, and when I entered I was sur¬prised to see
        candles burning in the sanctuary. I asked, &#8220;Who is light¬ing
        candles in a Christian church?&#8221; and my hosts replied, &#8220;All
        those who have someone ill at home come to this church, light candles,
        and ask God to heal the sick one.&#8221; (!) Another thing that
        impressed me was that on the hillside by the Monastery of St. John,
        everything was in ruins, but the church still stands with its marble
        tablet inscribed with the date of its<br />
        dedication: 1859.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, my poor monastery! Where are your gardens and your great plane
        trees? Only the crystal-clear spring still flows near the entrance,
        giving water for the entire village. I went into a nearby chapel. All of
        the wall paintings were destroyed, only a Cross remains with the
        let¬ters: IX NIKA [Jesus Christ Conquers]&#8230;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stone path brought us to the top of Saranton Hill, over which the
        Church of St. Theodore keeps a lonely watch. Not a single house still
        stands, only poor caves built by the shepherds&#8230; If you stand in
        front of the church, you command a fine view, a view that became
        impossible for me because of the tears that continually filled my eyes.
        From this spot, one can see the churches of Kromni, standing like proud,
        white castles, just as we left them at our exodus from Pontus. The
        church of Nanak, of Gluvena, of Loria, of Siamananton, of Manchianton,
        of Transfiguration, of St. Theodore of Geranton, of St. John of
        Frangaton! Every church, a community, an entire history, a heartfelt
        cry. I faced each one in turn, making the sign of the Cross and cried
        out the pain in my heart, as the tears streamed down my face&#8230;.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Alhazanton I went to the Church of Metamorphosis, which was built
        by my grandfather. Beside the church was the grave of my father&#8217;s
        sister, my godmother in baptism. The grave was unfenced and the school
        without a roof. Ruins everywhere&#8230;
      </p>
      <p>
        Pairamanton. Our two houses there were the best in all of Kromni. Ruins.
        I went to the spring that was next to the house of my uncle, Kostas
        Sidiropoulos. With all the crying, my nose began to bleed -perhaps I am
        to purify my tears with blood&#8230;. At that spring there was always a
        bush, and I found the bush as I had left it half a century before. What
        memories were mixed with that bush, the most beloved place of our
        childhood where we played all of our games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, as if I had completed a pilgrimage, I prayed at the
        cemetery and left for Imera, following the same way to Gumushane
        (Argyroupolis).
      </p>
      <p>
        So this is Parthenope&#8217;s letter. Her mother&#8217;s death marked
        the passing of the last Greek soul of Trebizond. I say &#8220;the last
        Greek soul,&#8221; but it is better if I say instead, &#8220;the last
        known Greek soul,&#8221; because no one knows who else this ocean of the
        Orient still hides.
