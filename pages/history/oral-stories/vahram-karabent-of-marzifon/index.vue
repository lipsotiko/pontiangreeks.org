        Vahram Karabent of Merzifon, was an Armenian citizen from the Ottoman
        Empire born in the city of Merzifon in 1905.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the age of 10, Karabent witnessed the Ottoman Turkish deportation of
        the Armenians &#8211; four of his uncles, along with his Father and
        Grandfather were deported from their homes and never heard from again.
        Karabent along with his mother and brother, were the only members of his
        family to survive.

      <p>
        In addition to the suffering of the Armenian community, Karabent also
        witnessed similar measures taken by the Turks against the Greek
        community of Merzifon, and tells of the Greek resistance to the
        expulsions - below are excerpts from his story:
      </p>
      <p>
        “At that time the Sultan was still the ruler.The Sultan issued an
        imperial decree saying, &#8216;Those who become Muslims will
        remain!&#8217; Whether you were Armenian or Greek Orthodox, if you were
        willing to change your religion and become a Muslim, you would be saved.
        Those who refused to do so were rounded up and moved&#8230;. The
        government encouraged artisans and tradesmen who had necessary skills to
        adopt Islam and be saved. There were those who were saved in that
        way.&#8221;

        “The calamity didn&#8217;t spare the Greeks, either&#8230;Even as they
        were saying that things would be getting back to normal, the war began
        again.This time they began to attack the Greeks and subject them to
        things similar to what had been done to us. Ultimately, the calamity
        that had befallen us also befell the Greeks some five years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, take a look at the scar on my arm! Do you know where and how I
        received this wound? I&#8217;ll tell you!
      </p>
      <p>
        The year was 1920. I was fifteen years old. The calamity that had come
        upon the Armenians had passed, they said, but now Topal Osman&#8217;s
        gangs of brigands made their appearance in the regions around the Black
        Sea.They struck against the Greeks and murdered them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember it exactly how it happened. It was a Saturday. The Topal
        Osman gang came to Merzifon with the intention of carrying out a raid
        against the Greeks. But there weren&#8217;t that many Greeks left in
        Merzifon. And those who were there weren&#8217;t rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        During that time they started to deport the Greeks. After the raids and
        attacks by Topal Osman&#8217;s gangs, the Greeks who lived in the area
        began to disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expulsion of the Greeks wasn&#8217;t exactly like the Armenian
        Deportation, but still, expulsion is expulsion. May no one ever have to
        go through it! We couldn&#8217;t do a thing to help the Greeks. We had
        no means with which to do anything for them. And we were scared. We were
        hopeless and alone. It was like the whole world was against us.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a lot of Greeks in the region of Amasya, in Samsun and on the
        Black Sea coast. And the Greeks didn&#8217;t submit meekly like the
        Armenians had. They also formed armed bands. They armed themselves and
        fled to the mountains. They defended themselves up there.If they
        hadn&#8217;t taken up arms to defend themselves, not a single one of
        them would have survived. It wasn&#8217;t like in 1915. The Greeks were
        strong. They fought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the Greeks died, others were killed. Those who had caiques or
        boats fled to Russia. Others fled to Greece or were sent there.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the enormity of the disaster that befell the Armenians can&#8217;t
        be compared to that of the Greeks. Only a very few of the Armenians
        managed to survive&#8230; no more than one or two from any family or
        line. But those things that happened to the Greeks can still be seen as
        comparable in some ways to the calamity that befell the Armenians.
        During their dark days, most Greek families or lines lost one or two
        members.”
