        The Genocide Continues…<br />
        An Authentic Sincere Testimony<br />

        Finally seeing the light of day, is one of the thousands of unknown but
        genuine firsthand accounts of the appalling events that followed the
        implementation of genocidal measures by the Young Turks against the
        Greek Christian population of the Pontus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following account was written by Grigoris Lipiridis, born in the
        village of Partin in the prefecture of Argyropoulis in the Pontus region
        of Asia Minor in 1904. His parents were Christos and Rebecca. In 1924,
        along with four sons, Grigoris, Lefteris, Kostas ad Theodore and two
        daughters Anatoli and Margarita, he settled in the village of Xerolimni
        of the Kozani prefecture. Two of the daughters of the family died in
        quarantine at Selimiye in Constantinople In Xerolimni, Grigoris married
        Kyriaki (Kitsa) of the Rodopoulos family from the “Nanak” settlement of
        Kromnis, a neighboring village of Partin. He died in Xerolimni in 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months before his death, Grigoris Lipiridis felt obligated to
        write his story and tell of the nightmarish journey that lasted 27
        months, undertaken when he was only 18 years old. During this time, he
        survived the Pontian Greek genocide started by the Young Turks and their
        allies, and finished by Mustafa Kemal.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a bit of paper and expressed in the simple, yet sincere words of a
        man with only a 2nd grade education &#8211; Lipiridis recorded the
        heartbreaking pain he suffered during those 27 months in exile. He was
        fortunate to be among those who survived and were set free after the
        Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 that authorized the exchange of populations
        between the Greek and Turkish states.

        Further comments regarding the testimony of the events are
        unnecessary.The photocopy of the original narrative with its
        authenticated signature, (only edited to correct spelling), says it all.
        We wish to express our gratitude to the daughter of Grigoris Lipiridis,
        Penelope, who brought to light her father&#8217;s unknown story, and
        Nikos Kiriazidis, who contributed the family facts of “Barba” Grigoris,
        in whose memory we light a candle with the publication of his written
        testimony.

        “They grabbed me &#8211; those barbaric Turks &#8211; may they be
        banished from the face of the earth! On March 2, 1922 I was taken into
        exile into the depths of Turkey -Erzurum, Erzekian, Mama-Hatum,
        Sarikamis, Caucasus, Hasan Kale, &#8211; into the forests alongside wild
        animals, bears, wolves, wild boars, foxes and many assorted birds.
        Meanwhile, there was the very big Euphrates River, which joined with the
        Tigris River to flow into the Persian Gulf. I became familiar with all
        these things during those 27 months of exile. At the same time,
        frostbite, illness and the most debilitating disease &#8211; typhus
        &#8211; attacked my body, turning it yellow like a wax candle, and only
        by a miracle did I survive this evil sickness in the hospital at Erzurum
        with a fever of 41C. Finally, let's just say that I “recovered” and was
        sent to Sarikamis, surrounded by mountains and forests. Hungry and
        barefoot, we chopped wood and coal for the battalion&#8230;while fleas
        crawled through our naked bodies. For rations there was barley bread and
        soup. And we had to eat it cold. Those disgraceful Turks deliberately
        would not let us have a warm meal. Finally winter came and all was
        covered by snow. They brought us to Erzurum where we were forced to
        labor in stables with oxen and wagons to serve the officers; this is how
        almost all the Christians perished. Only a few of us were lucky. 70-80%
        never made it out of the mountains of Erzurum, Sarikamis and Caucasus
        &#8211; let the Turks face up to that!
