          >The Pontian Greek dialect can be traced back to the first Hellenic
          colonists, the Ionians of Miletus at the beginning of the 8th century
          B.C. Throughout the ages the Pontian dialect was influenced by the
          different languages spoken by neighboring peoples, especially during
          the long era of Ottoman rule. The Greek origin of this dialect,
          however, can be traced to the ancient Ionian speech of the first Greek
          settlers.</strong

          Sourmena and Ophi speak the Pontian dialect.</strong

        The dialect of Pontos is one of the two Greek dialects spoken in Asia
        Minor (the other being Cappadocian) that are today almost extinct as
        spoken languages and constitute an object of study only as
        &#8220;museum&#8221; languages. For many years the Pontic dialect has
        exhibited the following paradox: while every dialect is associated with
        a specific geographical area: for example Epirotic with Epirus, Thracian
        with Thrace etc., the Pontic dialect today is not associated with any
        geographical area. This was an outcome of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne,
        signed by Eleftherios Venizelos and Kemal Ataturk, which provided for
        the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations. That was when the Greeks
        of Pontos came to Greece and settled throughout the mainland, chiefly in
        the countryside, towns and villages as well as in the larger urban
        areas. The bulk of Pontic refugees settled in Macedonia and Thrace but
        many wound up in Athens, Piraeus, Thessaloniki and other cities large
        and small.

        Pontic is one of the most studied, if not the most studied, of the
        Modern Greek dialects. This is due to its archaizing, medieval structure
        that early on aroused the interest of great linguists such as G.
        Hatzidakis, I M. Triantafyllides, N.P Andriotes, A. A. Papa-dopoulos and
        others. These linguists, working within the research environment of
        their time, analysed the Pontic dialect and demonstrated that certain
        linguistic features of classical Greek, and in particular of the
        classical Ionic dialect were preserved only in Pontic. In this way, (in
        conjunction with other evidence from Greek antiquity including history,
        folklore etc.) they believed they had irrefutably proved the continuous
        presence of the ancient Hellenic element, especially the linguistic one,
        in modern manifestations of the Greek presence. This continuity had been
        questioned by Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer and had to be upheld in every
        way.

        The exhaustive research into and study of the Pontic dialect resulted in
        a number of basic works, some of which appear in the bibliography that
        follows. The principal centre conducting these studies into the Pontic
        dialect and into other aspects of Pontic culture, history, folklore,
        folk art etc, is the Committee of Pontic Studies (EPM) from its
        foundation in 1927 to this day. The EPM, in its journal Archeion Pontou
        (which will soon number 50 volumes) and in its Appendices, which are
        independent publications (23 volumes to date), has published countless
        papers on the idiosyncrasies of the Pontic dialect. The various subjects
        covered have included phonology-phonetics, morphology, etymology,
        semantics and syntax, as well as other systematic studies of historical
        grammar and vocabulary. Additionally, it is worth mentioning the
        significant, and continually increasing, number of linguistic studies
        carried out in Greek and foreign universities which have ranged from
        simple studies to doctoral theses.
