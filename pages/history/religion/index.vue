          Religion and education are the two factors that have helped the
          survival of Pontian Hellenism from antiquity to the present. In the
          year 35 A.D., the Apostle Saint Andrew was the first preacher of
          Christianity in the Pontus region and by the 2nd century A.D.,
          Christianity quickly spread to the coastal Black sea area and the
          inner region of Pontos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the centuries, Pontos produced well known scholars such as
          Bessarion (theologian, philosospher), Georgios Amiroutzis, Georgios
          Chrysokokkis (physician, astronomer), Genadios of Trebizond, Saint
          Eugenius of Trebizond and many others.

          During the Comnenus dynasty (1204-1461), the cultural and educational
          activities of the Pontos reached their highest peaks.

          According to Diamantis Lazaridies, Vice-Chairman of the Committee of
          Pontic Studies in his essay “The Pontos of the Hellenes” published by
          Ephesus Publishing:
        </p>
        <p>
          “….…the religious belief of the Pontians ran very deep, was purely
          Orthodox and was cultivated by the Church, the school and the family.
          The product of this faith was the large number of places of worship
          -churches, monasteries, chapels and country churches-which one could
          see in cities, tons, and villages, in the forests and on the hills.
        </p>
        <p>
          ”Sophronis Hatzisavvides, Professor of Linguistics, Aristotelian
          University of Thessaloniki in his essay “Greek Education in Pontos”,
          published by Ephesus Publishing, observed the significance of religion
          and education to the Pontian Greeks:
        </p>
        <p>
          “.. &#8230;.one might conclude that by saying that the high
          educational and cultural level of Trebizond and of Pontos as a whole,
          which was based on the Greek language, Orthodox tradition and
          engagement with scholarly pursuits, made it possible for refugees from
          Pontos to overcome the problems they faced and to integrate easily
          into Greek society” after they were expelled from their homeland.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the centuries following the Ottoman Turk conquest in 1461,
          religious practice and education was held hostage to the attitudes of
          the various Ottoman rulers: but even during these difficult years, the
          Pontian Greeks managed to preserve their religion, culture, tradition
          and dialect until their expulsion.
