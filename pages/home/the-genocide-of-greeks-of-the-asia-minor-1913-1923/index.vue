        />While many of us teach about the Armenian genocide, few today know
        what happened to the Greeks of Asia Minor, as well as to the Assyrians,
        who together lost more than a million people as part of one of first
        large-scale genocides of the 20th century, which Ottoman Turkey
        committed against its Christian minorities. Join IHMEC and The Asian
        Minor and Pontos Hellenic Research Center as we equip participants to
        return to their classrooms with deeper knowledge of the genocide,
        learning why, how, what, when, and where the genocide of the Greeks of
        the Asia Minor took place, including key historical antecedents that led
        up to the atrocities, as well as the aftermath and denial that still
        takes place.

        Through the analysis and evaluation of primary sources, including
        Survivor narratives, interactive text and graphics, and diaries,
        participants will actively engage in a direct connection with the
        reflections of those involved in the genocide, and bring a more personal
        dimension to this often forgotten history.<br />
