        Conference held on November 7, 2009 at the Westin Hotel in Rosemont,
        Illinois
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference focused on the Hellenic experience in Asia Minor, Pontus
        and Eastern Thrace during the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup>
        century and the events that followed the “Megali Catastrophe”.

        “The purpose of the conference,” said George Mavropoulos, President of
        the Society, “is to present original new research on the ethnic
        cleansing and genocide of the Greeks of Asia Minor, Pontus, and Eastern
        Thrace from 1913 to 1923.” Mr. Mavropoulos added, “We want to make a
        significant contribution to the scant body of literature on the subject
        in English to help promote awareness and understanding of this most
        crucial period in our modern history.” He stressed the importance of
        last year's and today's conference in order to promote research,
        knowledge, and the culture of Hellenism in Asia Minor and Pontus.

        After the Greek-Vice Consul and representatives from the various Greek
        organizations were invited to say a few words, Mr George Shirinian was
        introduced to act as a moderator. Mr. Shirinian, director of the Zoryan
        Institute in Toronto, Canada in his opening remarks briefly discussed
        the previous year's conference, the need for more publication, more
        scholars, and training in the languages involved such as Greek,
        Armenian, and Turkish. “These efforts, he sated “lead to constructive
        and powerful action.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Shirinian added, “If the Greek community wants to bring out the history
        of Asia Minor Hellenism and Pontus and have it told to the world, then
        it must seize the opportunity and give every support possible—moral,
        material, and financial—to the initiative being undertaken by George
        Mavropoulos, the Pontian Greek Society of Chicago, and the team of
        scholars who are working towards the creation of a permanent, formal
        research center.”

        The first speaker was Dr. Taner Akçam, Associate Professor of History
        and holder of the Robert Aram &amp; Marianne Kaloosdian and Stephen and
        Marion Mugar Chair in Armenian Genocide Studies at Clark University. His
        paper, “The Greek Deportations and Massacres of 1913-1914, A Trial Run
        for the Armenian Genocide,” was particularly valuable for using
        previously unpublished Ottoman documents. He addressed the elements and
        the calculated methods of destruction of non-Turkish minorities, namely
        the Greeks, Armenians, and Assyrians along with their respective
        cultures. The goal of the Ottoman government was to “free themselves of
        a non-Turkish elements in the Aegean by killing and annihilating them.
        He went on to explain the government's dual policy -one legal, the other
        private. In the legal policy, they presented a face of “humanitarianism”
        in their manner of “moving” or “deporting” their unwanted populations,
        while privately, they conducted illegal and treacherous activities
        against productive and peaceful Christian members of their society. In
        his concluding remarks, Dr. Akcam explained that the Greek massacres and
        deportations were so successful that they became the forerunners for the
        Armenian Genocide.

        Dr. Constantine Hatzidimitriou, Adjunct Professor History at St. John's
        University, spoke on “Official and Unofficial American Reactions to the
        Asia Minor 'Catastrophe': What the Documentary Evidence Reveals.” While
        providing details on the destruction of Smyrna in 1922, he presented a
        number of unpublished documents from the U.S. National Archives and
        showed how the American Embassy deliberately ignored information that
        demonstrated Turkish culpability. He talked about the Turkification of
        minorities and the seizing of their properties, the ethnic cleansing and
        cover-ups, which continue today. Large volumes of archival sources
        describe the destruction of the Greeks and especially the 350,000
        Pontian Greeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Matthias Bjørnlund, a Danish archival historian, spoke on “The
        Persecution of Greeks and Armenians in Smyrna, 1914-16: A Special Case
        in the Course of the Late Ottoman Genocides.” He discussed the
        destruction of Greek and Armenian communities in Smyrna and stated that
        the Danish Consul in Smyrna and Swedish eyewitness described the
        violence against these people, and the Austrian Consulate reported mass
        arrests of Armenians. They were witness to efforts by the Committee for
        Union and Progress for the violent homogenization of the ethnic and
        religious make-up of Anatolia before and during WWI. He then went on to
        explain the official policy of the Ottoman government to rid of the
        minorities through expulsions and use of torture, intimidation, and
        violent persecution. In his concluding remarks, Bjonlund said that, in
        general the European countries and the U.S. try to place a lid on the
        Greek and Armenian genocides for economic reasons.

        Dr. Alexander Kitroeff, Associate Professor of History at Haverford
        College, gave an extended presentation on “The Plight of the Greek
        Refugees after the Break-up of the Ottoman Empire.” He discussed the
        importance of photographic evidence, which documents the way people
        live, the destruction, the burning, as well as the superficial or
        obvious, such as symbols, flags—things we take for granted. Dr. Kitroeff
        discussed the resettlement of the Ottoman Greeks in Greece in the
        1920's, their adoption of a “refugee identity” based on their place of
        origin and the memories it generated—their common experience of violence
        and displacement, and their treatment by others. Using a number of
        photographs, he illustrated how these refugees retained a strong sense
        of their Anatolian homeland and identity after being forcibly relocated
        to Greece. For the Ottoman Greeks, it was resettlement in the 1920's;
        establishment and incorporation in the 1930's to 1950's; and upward
        social mobility in the 1960's to 1980's. The professor concluded his
        presentation by saying that for political reasons, the Greek government
        does not want to raise the issue of the Greek Catastrophe, and so refers
        to it in indirect ways, such as literature.

        Dr. Van Coufoudakis, Rector Emeritus at the University of Nicosia, in
        Cyprus and Dean Emeritus of the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana
        University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne, spoke on “From Lausanne
        (1923) to Cyprus (2009): Turkey's Violations of International Law and
        the Destruction of Historic Hellenic Communities.” He described how the
        Pontian Greeks and the Armenians were forcibly removed from their
        homes—their ancestral homeland dating back 3,000 years—because of their
        ethnicity, religion, language, and culture. Dr. Coufoudakis illustrated
        the continuity of foreign and domestic policies of the Ottoman Committee
        for Union and Progress with those of ensuing administrations of the
        Republic of Turkey, providing an extensive list of violations of
        treaties, international law, and fundamental, universal human rights.
        Since 1923, international apathy, allows Turkey to continue with its
        violations of international laws with impunity; and the practice of
        “blaming of others, which is how Turkey can deny what they did.”
        Coufoudakis concluded his presentation by stating that American and
        British policies against Turkey's violations are to overlook the actions
        on the basis of political expediency for economic and strategic reasons.

        As the academicians took final questions from the audience, and then as
        Hatzidimitriou presented the closing remarks—in which he discussed
        “placing the events of the Anatolian Genocide in the broader context of
        Hellenic and world history”—I could not help but think of the final two
        lines of the poem, “They Thought They Were Free”: “…When they came for
        me, there was no one left to speak out.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the conference Mr.George Shirinian, stated: today's
        conference is a great success. I saw some exciting original research
        presented here, and its publication will make a great contribution to
        our knowledge and understanding of this neglected subject.”
