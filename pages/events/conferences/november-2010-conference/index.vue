        The third annual Academic Conference on the Pontian and Anatolian Greek
        Genocide presented five scholars who discussed of events before, during,
        and after the first world's genocide of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. The
        conference was moderated by George Shrinian, Executive Director of the
        International Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies of the
        Zoryan Institute.

        In his introductory remarks, Mr Shrinian emphasized the Greeks,
        Armenians, Assyrians, and other groups that have experienced genocide
        have much to teach the world. The world has been unwilling to intervene,
        and genocide and ethnic cleansing still occur today. These violations of
        human rights cannot be forgotten or overlooked because when any group's
        right are trampled, no one is secure.

        He urged Greek-Americans to support scholarly research of the Pontian
        and Greek experience; most now is not funded, either publicly or
        privately. The papers presented at this conference will be published in
        a book so these original works will be available for generations to
        come.

        Tessa Hofmann, PhD, Freie Universität, Berlin, Germany, presented her
        paper, “The Genocide against the Christians in the late Ottoman period
        1912-1922.” She presented the events that led to and intensified the
        genocide of 3 million Christians, the first time in modern history where
        a state turned against its own citizens. Military defeats and reforms
        imposed by foreign powers were humiliating to the Turkish self-image.
        The Ottoman government's retaliation was to create a Muslim Turkish
        state by force of arms, a policy that continued and intensified despite
        changes in government leadership.

        Alexander Kastrinakis, PhD candidate, Aristotelian University,
        Thessaloniki, Greece, presented his paper, “In Adam's exile; the
        consequences of an anticipated crime and the idealized search for
        Greece.” The exodus from the ancestral land was examined through the
        experiences of a Pontian family from Trebizond. The family left Pontos
        for Odessa in the Ukraine, relocated to the Jerusalem, and finally
        migrated to Greece. Mr Kastrinakis examines the state terrorism events
        of the late 19<sup>th</sup>
        Century that culminated in 1918 with the Kemalist's campaign to deprive
        the last Christians of their citizenship.

        Harry Psomiades, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Queens College and the
        Graduate School of the City University of New York, presented “Greece in
        Asia Minor; the Greek naval bombardment of Samsun, June 7, 1922.” In the
        year prior to the bombardment, the Allied powers deprived Greece of its
        normal belligerent rights under International Maritime Law to blockade
        an enemy port. The bombardment did not stop the flow of war materials to
        the Kemalists, who then declared the Pontos a war zone and used the raid
        as justification to increase their massacre of the Greeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        William Samonides, PhD, Historian and Professor Emeritus of Harvard
        University, presented “Where did everybody go? The Diaspora of Asia
        Minor Hellenes in the early 20<sup>th</sup>
        Century.” Those who left first went primarily to Greece and Russia. The
        Greek population in Turkey that converted to Muslim was forbidden to
        leave. Many Asia Minor Greeks later migrated to the United States,
        Canada, Germany, and Australia. Dr Samonides defined the features of the
        five types of Diaspora and discussed the changes in US immigration
        policies that imposed a 100 person per year quota on immigrants from
        Asia Minor after World War I that wasn't lifted until after World War
        II.

        The conference's final presentation was by Robert J. Pranger, PhD, a
        private consultant with extensive experience in public policy with the
        Department of State and Department of Defense in Washington, DC. His
        paper “US policy obstacles in recognizing the genocides of Christian
        minorities in the late Ottoman Empire: challenges and opportunities”
        gave extensive examples of how Turkey plays a central role in the Middle
        Eastern foreign policy of the US and Europe. Because Turkey is a valued
        ally, it has been able to advance its version of events and squash any
        official accusations of its participation in the genocide of its
        Christian citizens.

        Historians and students of history understand the power in studying
        history. Ron Levitsky, retired middle school teacher, reminded the
        audience that history shapes today's world for good or ill. Revisionist
        history and denial by Turkey of its role in the genocide of Greeks,
        Armenians, and Assyrians has been supported by democratic governments
        that profit from political and business alliances with Turkey.
