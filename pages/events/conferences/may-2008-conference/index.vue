          a research center specializing in the history of the Greeks of Asia
          Minor and Pontus can be set up. The Pontian Genocide is important in
          the larger field of human rights studies and is therefore relevant
          today.

          >The trauma of the 1915 genocide was so overwhelming for
          Armenians—especially in the diaspora—that they were still in survival

          strategies.</em

          >The forum would reestablish Armenian intellectuals in a leadership
          role as part of an effort to understand what happened, how it
          happened, and why it happened. What does it mean to be an Armenian
          when your people have not lived in Armenia for centuries? What are the
          markers of Armenian identity, and can you have more than one cultural
          identity?

          involvement. The world's people today are more aware of genocide and
          more receptive to learning about it. They understand it is a gross
          violation of human rights and when one people's rights are trampled,
          their own are not secure. We must all promote awareness to prevent it
          from happening again. Promoting awareness of the Pontian genocide is
          an integral part of this process.

      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Harry Psomiades:</strong>
        We are fortunate that much of the groundwork for the study of genocide
        in Asia Minor has been done by Armenian scholars with whom we share
        common experiences in place and in time. It is their pioneering work,
        particularly since the last four decades, that has paved the way for a
        better understanding of what happened, how it happened and why these
        monstrous acts of inhumanity took place in Anatolia during World War 1
        and its aftermath. Undoubtedly, the study of genocide world wide derives
        its impulse from the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust in Nazi Germany and
        by the United Nations active involvement in genocide prevention. An area
        completely ignored by its predecessor the League of Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the survivors of the Greek genocide who came to Greece or went
        to the diaspora had been so profoundly traumatized by their experiences
        (the suicide rate in the first year upon their arrival in Greece was
        more than twice the rate of the native population) and so completely
        involved with the task of mere survival that their story was delayed for
        an inordinate period of time. This silence was reinforced by the Greek
        Governments&#8217; desire not to compromise its relationship with its
        Turkish neighbor. Moreover, the international community was in a denial
        mode. Finally, a significant portion of the intellectual elite of Pontic
        Hellenism had been exterminated in the death marches and in the
        Kemalist&#8217; prisons of Amasia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Psomiades is currently working on a major study about Fridtjof
        Nansen, the famous Norwegian explorer and League of Nations High
        Commissioner, who helped the relief effort for refugees in the Near East
        after World War I.

      <p>
        <strong> Dr. Theofanis Stavrou: </strong>
        <em
          >Anna Sikelianos said, “I do not want you to forget—what happened and
          what historians think happened.” History isn't fact until it is
          written about. In the 20th century, the people of Asia Minor were not
          historical fact because the expulsion and exterminations were not
          talked about. Few studies were done on behalf of the Greeks and Asia
          Minor. We can learn from the Armenians that we should not expect Greek
          experiences to be researched by others. Greeks must write the history
          of the Greeks of Asia Minor.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Do history properly, but do it in dialogue with others.
          Contextualizing is important. We can be pessimistic that little has
          been done to understand the resilience and survival of the Armenians
          and Greeks. They need to be studied.

      <p>
        <strong>Dr. William Samonides:</strong>
        He came to Pontian studies reluctantly—he was not aware of it and mostly
        not interested. But it took hold when he was working on a family history
        project that went out of control. It started when he talked to the Greek
        community in Canton, Ohio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Largely unexplored was the history of the Pontian Greek people there.
        They were proud of their past but couldn't articulate it—they felt their
        story was important but lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gathered Pontian history in the U.S. so it would not be irretrievably
        lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gather documents and photos. Videotape and preserve the memories of the
        older generation—the first generation of Pontian Greeks that came
        here—because they know the story of their parents. An important part of
        the Pontian experience is the survival story of the tens of thousands of
        Pontians who immigrated to America. The study of the Pontian diaspora in
        North America is important to the larger story of the Pontians. Their
        unique story is also a universal story. This makes it important because
        of our shared humanity and shared inhumanity.

        <strong>Professor Eleni Phufas:</strong>
        Her background is Arcadian, not Pontian, so she came to the topic
        through her Sudanese students. Leni Riefenstahl, biographer of Adolf
        Hitler, lived in the Sudan. Her students talked about the terrible
        genocide and oppression there. She began reading and viewed a film by an
        Armenian who told the story of the genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
        She translated the book,
        <em>Noumero 31328: The Book of Slavery</em> by Elias Venezis, who
        himself was a survivor of a slave march and forced labor brigades for 18
        months in Asia Minor/Turkey during the 1920s. The essence of the
        translation was not the literal words but bringing into English from the
        original Greek the feelings expressed by the author. Professor Phufas
        wants to use scholarly resources to popularize stories—translate more
        personal memoirs into English.
      </p>

      <p>The panelists took questions and comments from the floor:</p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: In regard to the 40 years of silence: Why didn't the older
          generation speak of their experiences?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: They were so traumatized, they just
        wanted to forget and go on with their lives. The refugees who came to
        Greece had difficulty adjusting—they were resented by the locals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pain was so great, but they had to put it aside to adjust to new
        situations. There was guilt among those who survived, while so many
        others did not. Parents did not want to burden their children with
        irresolvable experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: How do we popularize what happened? What do we do in North America
          to get recognition from the U.S. and Canadian governments? How do we
          get it in the minds of non-Pontians? Do we need movies? Articles?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Literature and fiction are good but
        first you need to establish the facts. Memoirs are not considered
        definitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Lots of people are not convinced. Having
        lots of photos is good. Workshops are needed to share experiences and
        develop practical measures we can take.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our identity and background in the modern world are ideas that are
        promoted through universities—universities provide a forum that has a
        multiplying effect through generations of students. Teaching students
        has a multiplying effect to their families, friends, and associates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything helps, but be especially concerned that we integrate
        experiences of these people into the curriculum of the university.
        People coming out should at least be aware.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em>: Do Pontians have a role in creating chairs at universities?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: This is one objective a small group can
        take to get money, instead of presenting lots of ideas and getting
        nothing done.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: One concern with a university is the
        proposal must demonstrate that there are appropriate educational
        resource materials—and we are not there yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: We also need to demonstrate significant
        interest. Today, schools in Greece teach about classical Greece; little
        is taught about Byzantium, even before the Pontians.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the Japanese government spends millions on education.
        Warner educated Stimson to glories of Japanese culture. Movies, novels,
        exhibits—yes to all—put a face to suffering. Large groups have power to
        communicate, but it is not same as creating something that can touch
        people directly as photos, movies, and literature can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: The Greek government has a problem
        sponsoring this education. The Turkish government, on the other hand,
        spends millions to establish university chairs for the Turkish
        revisionist line. The government should not be invoked to politicize a
        subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: How do the Armenians view the radical acts that accompanied the
          protests? What is the effect on the Pontians?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: The Armenians' success came from the
        diaspora community during the '70s and '80s. Because of the exchange
        treaty, the case for recognition of the Pontian case as a genocide is
        diminished. The geopolitics of Greece is its relationship to NATO, and
        this affects the Greek government's actions relating to this history.
      </p>
      <p>
        A scholar can provide the tools for support in appeals to the
        government, but the Greeks don't have strong documentation and a good
        argument now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: We must establish this as an area of
        serious study. There is a record of attempts to get the Turks to
        acknowledge genocide, but all of it stopped. There are no official
        trials on the Pontian side. In 1921, it was obvious and clear what
        happened in Pontus because it was reported by allies of Turkey (the
        Frunze diary). Initially, he was against the Greeks, but he ended up
        calling for the atrocities to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In spring of 1922, British and American missionaries published what
        happened in Pontos. The Western powers said a commission should be
        formed and then argued about who should pay for it. In the end, the
        League did not go far because the Turks limited inquiries to western
        Anatolia, where there were minor atrocities compared to Pontus. The
        Turks insisted no one go to Pontus.

        The Commission of Inquiry never took place because the Turks would not
        come to the peace table at Lausanne. The Turks needed to give permission
        for the return of Turks from Greece. If Greece expelled the Turks,
        resettling refugee Greeks could fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great powers wanted Turkish cooperation for other reasons, so they
        didn't want to pursue the inquiry. The compulsory exchange (the first in
        the world) legitimized Turkish ethnic cleansing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: We can't justify Pontian genocide. Others
        are not willing to accept the Pontian genocide because not enough
        overwhelming scholarly information supports it. The task is the
        preparatory work that will make the case. Greek works need to be
        translated. There are lots of areas to be explored.

        Third Session Discussion: Telling the Story: Publishing and
        Disseminating the Story of the Fate of the Asia Minor and Pontian Greeks
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Prof. Stavrou told us history is not a
        fact until someone writes about it. The Zoryan Institute was formed in
        1982 because documentation was important. What are the archival sources
        for Greek history?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Memoirs and published histories are
        secondary sources because they have no footnotes, but they constitute
        95% of history. In fact, some have documentation, but sources are not
        cited for Pontos histories, or the footnotes shown are too general.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Any fact cited must be verifiable, or it
        won't be accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: There are excellent archives in Athens, at
        the Center for Asia Minor Studies. The 1908-1922 period has so many
        dimensions, including documents in Russia, personal archives of Greeks
        of the diaspora, and personal libraries of Greeks that are not public
        and unavailable to scholars until they are bequeathed to a public
        institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is information—how do you identify and preserve it so it is
        accessible by scholars who can document what is said?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: There are many sources for the early
        lives of Pontian immigrants in the U.S. Since all men registered for the
        draft, lots of information was collected on them, such as date of birth,
        place of birth, where they lived, etc. Other sources include
        naturalization papers, census information, church records, and city
        directories. There are newspaper articles about what was going on in the
        Pontian community. There are ship manifests that tell who the person
        came to visit, their relationship, and who was left behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: The U.S. government was involved with
        the Ottoman Empire, so there is a wealth of information: diplomatic
        correspondence for the U.S., Great Britain, France, Germany; Russian and
        Ottoman archives. These are good sources that provide lots of work for
        many generations of scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Students need to have the languages—it is
        best to know 4 to 5 languages. The archives will be written in 15-20
        languages. There exists a catalog of names and maps of areas to be
        exterminated. This provides intent on the part of the Turks and is part
        of the debate on denying genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to train people in the languages they need to do the research so
        the story can be told in all its complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Consider the physical nature of the
        documents. Many are handwritten paper documents located in other
        countries. One can take photos of them or scan them and post them on the
        Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: When you write articles, include as much
        of the original document as possible in the body of the paper. This is
        another way of getting original information to more and more people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: There is a lifetime of work for
        scholars. When language ability is limited or at the undergraduate
        level, original scholarship can be done using public works, for example.
        Photos are very important—scan them and find information about them
        while people are still available who can do this. For unidentified
        photos, put them on website for a wider audience of people to see and
        provide identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Photographic evidence is doubly
        powerful. There are many ways of identifying photos, such as by the
        background curtain used in a certain studio, or other identifying marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: Hold photo parties. Bring copies of old
        photos and invite people to identify them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Owners often don't want to part with
        photos until it is too late. Children will clean out a collection and
        toss old photos if they don't know the people. Sometimes photo libraries
        are brought in but they may be only partial collections. We need to save
        entire collections—get owners to promise to donate the library but let
        them hold onto them until they are ready to part with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important when preserving material to notify the community and
        make a master catalog of what's available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: Ask for old 78 rpm records. Make copies
        and keep a collection of Pontian music.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Professor Phufas</strong>: Look to other visuals, not just
        books. There are Pontian Greek and Asia Minor Greek families who have
        websites. Some have Web pages with photos and stories. Link to these
        sites through an online portal. Use technology to reach out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: As to the location of archival material, we know several countries
          where individual professors have it. It needs to be released so work
          is not duplicated. We need to start to know where material exists and
          ask if the individual will give us the information.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: One reason this is difficult is they are
        still using the material. When a research center is set up, Dr.
        Psomiades will turn over all material, except what he is currently
        working on. Not many scholars have material—about a handful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Sometimes scholars hold documents and
        won't share them. You need to establish one place to locate them and
        share them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: We need to credit the person who did the work. Often it is a
          problem to read something and then try to find a document that is
          listed in reference.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: When you have a center doing serious
        work and it is seriously financed, you will be surprised at how much
        comes in. We don't have such an archive anywhere in the world right now,
        though one is being set up in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Professor Pfufas</strong>: Why can't you digitally archive
        materials so they are transmittable anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Part of the reason is they don't want to
        release documents for duplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: We need to know who is working on what archives so work is not done
          twice. Government organizations in Turkey have archives, too.
          Rockefeller Center in New York, the International Red Cross, YMCA,
          missionary works (they wrote with lots of detail). There are
          university archives not yet seen. We also need young scholars to do
          this work.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: YMCA archives are part of social work
        archives at University of Minnesota. Your list is indicative of the
        immensity of the problem. Once you establish a base to house archives,
        you have incentive and pressure to get these documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, you can't just bring a load of archives to, say, the University of
        Chicago. They won't take it because space and personnel, etc., are
        limited. It helps if you have one staff person studying in the subject
        area. Librarians are there to preserve materials until the right person
        comes along to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, gather materials so you can approach a university with something
        real.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: We all see the necessity of a center for Pontian and Asia Minor
          archives. Where will the funds come from to gather, store, and

          conjunction with an educational institution or another cultural
          institution?</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: We're brainstorming the business case.
        You need to overwhelm the community with the importance of this work to
        push this forward.

        <em

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>. They think of you as ambassadors, and you
        get compliments on your work. But they realize generations of people
        studied the Greek Pontians out of passion, and now no one is replacing
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greece sends a few million dollars to organizations around the world as
        a symbolic gesture. You need someone in the business or political world
        to get any money—it is very difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samonides</strong>: Both Psomiades and Stavrou have
        sacrificed and been honored by students and universities. They devoted
        much of their professional lives to establishing centers, but it is a
        thankless job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: All the funding for the Zoryan Institute
        since 1982 is from many individuals giving small donations of $100-$250
        each, plus a few large donors. The Greek diaspora will have to step
        up—don't depend on a government.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: The trip has been rough, but there is lots
        of satisfaction. Attract graduate students with fellowships endowed by
        private citizens. There is a lot of goodwill out there from Greeks and
        non-Greeks. Governments will do only so much—and they can create
        complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need a mechanism to approach citizens. You need long range planning,
        but you can do many things in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Question</em></strong
        ><em
          >: Look to the Pontian Greek organization in Greece for help—meet with
          their leadership to see how they can help. They know a center has to
          be established outside of Greece.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Taner Akçam is researching the common
        plight of the Armenians and Greeks in the ethnic homogenization policy
        of the Young Turks. Such research has to be disseminated to the public
        and governments, to motivate them that new work is being done and new
        information being uncovered. Solutions to support such work have to be
        proposed. The media can help, including the <em>Hellenic Voice</em> and
        <em>Greek Star</em> papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Greek media have space to fill and will print articles, especially
        if you include photos. Follow-up articles are needed. I recommend
        concentrating on written media—and do it over and over again. Write
        stories so people who are not familiar with the Pontian Greek Genocide
        will read about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Greek media should have been here. Mr. Shirinian volunteered to be
        part of a speakers bureau. The organization needs a Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research is essential. Scholars have obligations when publishing to make
        sure their work is original. This is a painstaking process that can take
        years, but there is a power to academic research. A publication
        documenting the German role in the Armenian genocide helped lead to its
        recognition in Germany, but it took 8 years of research and preparation.
        What does it take to interest a person to do research?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: I He went to Marseilles for the
        Constantinides archives, but his nephew, who inherited the archive, died
        just as I arrived. No one knows where the archives went.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: I am looking for an area of research on
        Pontian history, and I can help with promoting the subject through the
        work I do at the University of Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Why didn't the work of the Zoryan
        Institute go to the university? What is the history behind archives not
        being at a university but at an independent center?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Most of the scholars are with the
        university, but some aren't. If we attempted to institutionalize the
        archives, they may not have been accepted because the Armenian genocide
        is so politicized. What is the status of the Pontian Genocide?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: There is ongoing publishing in Greek,
        and several people make a living as Pontian scholars in Greece. Some of
        it has been translated into English. The problem is there is a lot of
        material that is just straight descriptive and not analytical.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have to rely on Greece to do the work because they get paid for it.
        No one can make a living at it here. It is disappointing there are no
        young scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Most work being done is not analytical. In
        reading Fotiadis' work, he was really impressed by the amount of
        productivity. All this is unknown outside Greece, because Greek scholars
        are not comfortable with English.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is encouraging that a few young scholars are getting degrees in the
        U.S. He would like to see a course in 20th century Europe, with emphasis
        on the Asia Minor disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mr. Shirinian</strong>: Zoryan has commissioned research from
        scholars. Discuss subjects that need to be addressed. What is the
        feasibility of a major translation program?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: Translation is so important because so
        many documents and works of fiction, memoirs, and first-person
        narratives are in Greek. These works are fabulous, emotionally touching,
        and have great interest beyond the Greek community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Translating Asia Minor Greek from the 1920s into English that is
        readable by an American audience requires a special translator.
        Translating academic Greek into English is also a specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will take hundreds of hours of research to figure out what some works
        mean—for example, some Turkish is written using some Greek characters.
        Greek of a particular era is not easily translated into English of
        another era. Making it accessible in another language means not a
        literal translation, but rather must be interpreted translations that
        don't lose the beauty of the original, the essence of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Narratives of people who came through the suffering need to be
        translated into English. These are moving memoirs. Why aren't more of
        them translated?
      </p>
      <p>
        Many first-person experiences haven't been written yet. These are
        important for posterity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: This is the kind of rich literature that,
        if translated, would make a strong impact as antiwar literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Greek literature is not as accessible as it should be. There is a
        project in Greece to publish about 50 works of modern Greek literature
        and to translate them into several languages. Two are now completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the entire program of 50 is completed, it will make a good resource
        for teachers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to translations of individual works, an anthology of several
        works of Asia Minor history would get an audience. This will lift Greek
        literature to modern European standards.

        <strong><em>Question</em></strong

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: The Fotiadis volumes, especially the 15th,
        which needs to be reedited. It requires some introductory pages and some
        work to make it sensible to an English-speaking audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Psomiades</strong>: It needs more than superficial work.
        There also is the problem of putting it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Smonides</strong>: The central issue is how to get scholarly
        works from the native language into English. We must cultivate more from
        scholars because now there is nothing to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Japanese put lots of effort and money into translating and making
        literature available to students to become the next generation of
        scholars. They published the works by bringing in professional
        translators but the end result was worthless. The best way is work with
        scholars who select works and translate them to make them accessible to
        English speakers. These were valuable and useful. The responsibility
        falls on the Greek government and Ministry of Education to do this.
      </p>
      <img src="~/assets/images/placeholder_300x200.jpg" />
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Stavrou</strong>: Don't expect the Greek government to do
        this. The Ministry of Education pays only $2,500 to a translator; no one
        will take the job. Copy editing and distribution is an even bigger
        problem for any book to be worth the investment—figure the printing cost
        times seven. If your book can recover these costs, it is worth printing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Works published by universities have their own credibility, but
        universities won't publish if they're not making money. The information
        must get into hands of an interested audience—both scholars and the
        general public.

      </p>
      <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
      <p>
        “The Institute for Asia Minor and Pontus Studies will be an
        international center devoted to the research and documentation of Greeks
        in Asia Minor and Pontus and their diaspora throughout the world, and to
        promote awareness of the catastrophic loss of these at the hands of the
        Ottoman Empire during the early 20th century.
