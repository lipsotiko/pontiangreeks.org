        Eleftherios Venizelos, like all complex phenomena, is not easily
        definable. It is impossible to compare him to some model because he is
        unique.

      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>
        Eleftherios Venizelos, like all complex phenomena, is not easily
        definable. It is impossible to compare him to some model because he is
        unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aristocratic and folksy, emotional and remote, democratic and
        authoritarianâ€” the elements of his personality combined within him in
        such a way as to startle both friends and enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was also a man of instantaneous choices and actions. In politics,
        what counts is timely intervention, even if some groups of people are
        ahead of their time or if large numbers of citizens fall behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who have studied Eleftherios Venizelos will agree that he proved
        an accomplished master in the art of the timely decision and the
        realization of the achievable.
