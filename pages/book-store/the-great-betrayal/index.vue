        The Great Betrayal: Economic Imperialism &#038; the Destruction of
        Christian Communities in Asia Minor by Edward Hale Bierstadt.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Great Betrayal was first published in 1924. It exposes the rivalries
        and competing economic interests of the Allied Powers in the aftermath
        of World War I, how the Allied Powers failed to demand from Turkey the
        protection of its Christian minorities, and how they chose to negotiate
        economic treaties with her rather than hold her accountable for the
        destruction of its Christian communities.

      <p>Quotes from “The Great Betrayal”</p>
      <p>
        “The nations want oil, because oil means money, and because it may well
        prove to be a deciding factor in another war. The minorities, the
        Armenians and the Ottoman Greeks, were either dead or in exile,
        destitute, naked and starving, and the public of America was straining
        every nerve for their relief- But, in the face of this, our
        representative at Lausanne was instructed to negotiate an economic
        treaty with Turkey. Our solemn promises to the Armenian people and to
        the Greek nation were set aside in favor of commercial relations.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “At Lausanne the private economic interests of the great Powers, those
        interests which had or hoped to have some investment in Asia Minor,
        requested their governments to instruct the representatives at the
        Conference to see that they were fully protected.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “The (Lausanne) treaty was signed in oil and sealed with the blood of
        Greeks and Armenians.”
