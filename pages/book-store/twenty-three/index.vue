      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>
        Author Efthimios N. Couzinos, a member of Turkey&#8217;s ill-fated Greek
        minority who later adopted the United States as his home, provides a
        vivid recollection of life in Turkey before, during, and after the First
        World War.
      </p>
      <p>
        Couzinos tells the story of the halcyon days of his youth before
        depicting the terrible ordeal that he and other Ottoman Greeks and
        Armenians experienced at the hands of the Turks and their leader Mustafa
        Kemal.
