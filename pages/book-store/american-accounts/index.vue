        The author writes…..“Even today, among Greek speakers the term “the
        Catastrophe” is commonly used to refer to the eradication of the Greek
        presence in Asia Minor. By the time the so-called exchange of
        populations was “completed” in 1924, most of the Greek communities, that
        survived thousands of years of foreign invasions and the assimilationist
        pressures of Ottoman Islam, were eliminated by the nationalist fervor of
        Turkish Kemalism.

        There is little doubt that this process resulted in the Genocide of
        Anatolian Hellenism. In fact, in several of the U.S. State Department
        documents reproduced in this volume it is acknowledged that the Kemalist
        authorities in Smyrna made it known to American representatives that the
        removal of the Christian population of the city was the “final decision
        of the National Government as a solution of the race problem.”
