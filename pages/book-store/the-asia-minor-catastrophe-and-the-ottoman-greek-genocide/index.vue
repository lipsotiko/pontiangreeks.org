      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>
        This book adds important new historical information and theoretical
        analysis to our understanding of both the specific fate of Greeks in the
        late Ottoman Empire and the overarching genocide of Greeks, Assyrians,
        and Armenians from 1914 to the 1920s..

        Especially impressive is the mix of established scholars whose work
        represents decades of incisive and groundbreaking research on various
        aspects of the Ottoman Turkish genocidal process that is at the
        foundation of our current understanding of that process with emerging
        scholars whose innovative work is opening up crucial new lines of
        inquiry.

        This book fills a significant gap in the literature and is likely to be
        a central text in teaching on its topic, advance awareness of the issue
        globally, and spur a major expansion of research on the genocide of
        Greeks and the broader genocide.
