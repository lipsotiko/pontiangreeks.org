      <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
      <p>
        This is an impeccably written and carefully researched study by a
        prominent political scientist. Harry Psomiades focuses on the most
        critical period (1921-23) that has left a permanent mark on the fortunes
        of 20th century Greece and Turkey.

        Two powerful personalities dominate the narrative: Eleftherios Venizelos
        and Fridtjof Nansen. The former was a prominent statesman who modernized
        his country and managed through carefully crafted regional alliances and
        insightful decisions to double Greece&#8217;s territory during the
        Balkan Wars and World War I.

        The latter was a dashing Norwegian adventurer and explorer and Nobel
        Prize winner, who remains a central figure in international humanitarian
        work through his associations with the League of Nations and the
        International Red Cross.
