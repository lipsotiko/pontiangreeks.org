                From the book The Pontos of the Hellenes, the article below,
                written by Veroniki Dalakoura &#8211; Kamara doctor of
                Anthropogeography, Researcher, is  posted here with the

                My wish to study Hekklisia tis Trapezountos [The Church of
                Trebizond], the sole work that deals in detail with one of most
                important cities on the coast of the Pontos, led me to become
                acquainted with its writer, Metropolitan Chrysanthos of
                Trebizond (1913-1925) and Archbishop of Athens (1938-1941). It
                is difficult to convey in a few pages even the outline of a
                personality with the stature of Metropolitan Chrysanthos. I will
                therefore emphasize those points that highlight the course of a
                prelate who on the one hand played a significant role at a
                critical period in the history of the Pontic Greeks, and on the
                other was distinguished as an outstanding church scholar for his
                intellectual and spiritual contribution and his moral fiber.

                />The man known to the world as Charilaos Philippidis, son of
                Zissis Philioglou, was born in Komotini (Gumulcina) in March of
                1881. Komotini was then a rural area that is described in detail
                in the Metropolitan&#8217;s Autobiography, and together with his
                traumatic childhood experiences, provide evidence of his
                indissoluble bonds with his family and homeland. The premature
                death of his father (merchant of wheat and silk­ worm cocoons)
                and two of his siblings created a profound trauma, as well as a
                sense of responsibility in the tender soul of little Charilaos.
                His widowed mother undertook the upbringing of her three
                surviving children, with the help of her sole protectors and
                supporters, her brother Yangos Karabasis and above all her
                sister Lambrini Pegiou (Pegiaina) who &#8220;even though she was
                illiterate and had no knowledge of commerce, ran the business
                splendidly,&#8221; as Chrysanthos wrote. He never forgot that
                &#8220;when later I was to be admitted to the Theological School
                of Chalce, my aunt Pegiaina gave me five gold Turkish pounds as
                my starting out money.&#8221; After completing his general
                education in Komotini, he continued his studies in
                Constantinople, at the famous Theological School of Chalce
                (1897-1903) where he made a name for himself with his brilliant
                studies and ethos (&#8220;&#8230; I once again received
                distinction in all subjects for the seventh year, which was as
                arduous as the sixth.&#8221;)
              </p>
              <p>
                After his studies were over, and upon their commendation of the
                Metropolitan Ioachim  Sgouros of Xanthi  to Metropolitan
                Constantinos Karatzopoulos of Trebizond, Charilaos was ordained
                archdeacon at the Cathedral of Trebizond, at which time he took
                the name Chrysanthos. He was appointed teacher  of religion at
                the city&#8217;s Frontisterio (school) and preacher. In 1904, at
                the age of just 23, he was  assigned  the duties  of Genikos
                Epitropos (representative of the Metropolitan) of the diocese of
                Trebizond, seat of an important vilayet,   and  thereby
                undertook  new  respon­sibilities. His success in resolving the
                problems that arose in the relations between Christians and
                Muslims (forced conversions to Islam, groundless prosecutions of
                Greeks, etc.) as well as his undisputed administrative
                abilities, increased the prestige of the young Epitropos, who
                was totally dedicated to the increasing demands of the diocese.
                &#8220;I spent these holidays too in Constan­tinople, without
                being able to visit my homeland[&#8230;] I am once again very
                sorry, but duty comes before all.&#8221; The sudden death of his
                beloved mother in May of 1905 found him in Trebizond. &#8220;I
                lamented and mourned her death grievously, but at the same time
                I continued my work and on Sunday I preached in the church of St
                George Tsartakli about sorrow related to God and man.&#8221; The
                death of the Metropolitan of Trebizond two months later shook
                the city. Chrysanthos, who was already rundown through grief
                over the loss of his mother and wishing to avoid any involvement
                in the succession process, began a tour of the remote
                monasteries of Pontos: St John of Imera, Kromni, the Pariadros
                plateau (summer pastures), Livera, the Soumela Monastery and the
                Monastery of St George Peristereotas. Upon his return,
                Chrysanthos addressed the newly elected Metropolitan
                Constantinos Arampoglouon behalf of the community: &#8220;coming
                into this community you will find it flourishing and prosperous
                for all&#8230;&#8221;
              </p>
              <p>
                Having become aware that he was expending all his creativity on
                his growing obligations (Exarch of the Monastery of Soumela,
                teacher at the Frontisterio of Trebizond, Epitropos of the
                Diocese), he decided at the end of the 1907 school year to
                resign from all his duties and devote himself to the purpose
                which attracted him and in which he had excelled: to continue
                his higher education in Western Europe, and in particular at
                Leipzig. The expenses of his stay there were borne by two
                friends from Trebizond who were pillars of the Greek community,
                Georgios Fostiropoulos and Constantinos Theophylaktos. The first
                stop was Vienna, where he attended classes in Philosophy by the
                famous professor Wundt, Canon Law by Zoom, and Lin­guisticsby
                Bruggeman. He met sociologist George Scleros (Georgios
                Konstantinidis) and made friends with poet and author
                Constantinos Hatzopoulos who dedicated two poems to him
                (&#8220;On a tree&#8221; and &#8220;On the same tree&#8221;),
                evidence of the close intellectual contact and friendship that
                linked the two men. Moreover, Chrysanthos kept up his relations
                with the intelligentsia. Athanasios Souliotis-Nikolaidis, D.
                Glinos, N. Politis, G.Hatzidakis, the famous English
                archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins, Stephanos and Ion Dragoumis,
                and Penelope Delta, who consulted him when she was writing the
                Life of Christ, were just a few of those in his immediate
                environment. His broadness of mind, profound culture and love of
                art were well known. We read in his Autobiography:
                &#8220;Throughout the school year, I took part in the rich
                artistic life of Leipzig, attending the entire series of
                Wagner&#8217;s works at the theatre, the then famous operettas
                of Vienna, productions of works by Schiller, Goethe and Ibsen,
                performed by first class theatre companies&#8230;”
              </p>
              <p>
                During subsequent years, Chrysanthos continued his studies in
                Switzerland (Lau­sanne), where he was fortu­nate enough to
                attend cou­rses in sociology given by Vilfredo Pareto and where
                also he chanced to meet musicologist Melpo Merlier, founder of
                the Centre for Asia Minor Studies in Athens  (&#8220;Every
                Saturday I was in audience of rehearsals for the Sunday music
                programs. Classical works were performed that were introduced
                and performed by the Greek artist and Melpo Logothetti, later
                Merlier.”)

                ><br />
                Chrysanthos returned to Constantinople in1911; he was
                immediately appointed Archivist at the Ecumenical Patriarchate
                and editor-in-chief of Ekklesiastiki Alitheia, the official
                journal of the Patriarchate. For the future metropolitan, this
                was the period of his initiation into issues of ecclesiastical
                order and tradition, giving him a more complete overview of
                Church problems. By publishing nu­merous papers in Ekklesiastiki
                Alkheia, he was given an opportunity, on the one hand, to put
                forward the political positions that reflected his own idealism,
                and on the other to make his presence felt on the intellectual
                level and as future leader. The following year, now an
                archimandrite, he was sent as Exarch to Venice to study the
                problems of the Orthodox community there. Chrysanthos submit­ted
                an enlightening memora­ndum recommending ways in which to save
                the com­munity&#8217;s property, which the Italian government
                was plan­ning to appropriate. The im­portance of this
                memoran­dum can be judged by the fact that it was used 35 years
                later in the ecumenical nego­tiations that followed  the peace
                treaty ending World War II.

                />On 18  May  1913, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, in response to
                the common demands of clergy and laity alike, elected
                Chrysanthos as Metropolitan of Trebizond. The church in
                Trebizond, having known Chrysanthos as a young but gifted
                deacon, became familiar with him as a prelate and national
                leader who undertook the duties of both moral shepherd and
                animating spirit and fighter in the effort to ensure the
                spiritual and physical survival of the people of his second,
                adopted home.
              </p>
              <p>
                The decade of the Chrysanthos pastorate unfortunately coincided
                with the final phase in the almost two-thousand-year history of
                the Pontic Greeks. The repercussions of the declaration of World
                War I transformed the Trebizond area as well as the entire
                Pontos into a battlefield where hordes of Turkish irregulars
                gave themselves over to plunder, rapine and violence in all
                forms against the Greek population.The metropolitan, with the
                diplomatic insight and acumen that characterized him, believed
                that, in order to stop these attacks, the Turks would have to be
                convinced of the absolutely law-abiding nature of the Greeks. He
                achieved this by hastening in person to Cemal Azmi Bey, the
                prefect (vali) of the vilayet, as guarantor of the Greeks, and
                by giving instructions to the Greek leaders of the neighboring
                ecclesiastical provinces of Rhodopolis and Chaldia to do
                likewise. Due to his intercession, the deportation of three
                hundred Greeks (Russian citizens) to the depths of Mesopotamia
                under most adverse weather conditions was canceled, as was the
                departure of the notorious &#8220;labour battalions&#8221; 
                (amele taburu) consisting of Greeks obliged to follow the army
                towards Diyarbakir and the Syrian frontier, where they were to
                work in heavy road-building projects until they dropped of
                exhaustion. Thus the Christians who had been conscripted into
                the labour battalions were not sent away from Trebizond, but did
                lighter tasks, while teachers, professors, chanters, sacristans
                and church wardens were exempted from the conscription.
                Chrysanthos provided a solution to another problem as well: the
                situation faced by the Greek communities in the Bulgarian-ruled
                Balkan provinces. While the negotiations Click to enlargefor an

                there was a danger that Western Thrace would be given to

                In April 1916, the Russians were approaching Trebizond. The
                Turkish authorities withdrew, assigning Chrysanthos, as
                president of the temporary administration of Greeks and Turks,
                to maintain the order and safety of the population, Christians
                and Muslims alike.The Metropolitan agreed and addressed Grand
                Duke Nikolay Nikolayevich, using his power and authority to the
                benefit of all the inhabitants of Trebizond. Chrysanthos tried
                to retain control, although his efforts to save the Armenians
                had not been effective. The   persecution   and extermination of
                the Armenians (1915-16)had outraged a large number of Russian
                soldiers, many of whom were of Armenianorigin. The Russians
                assigned him to run the  city,   having   full  confidence  
                in   his administrative and diplomatic abilities, and discerning
                in his person a guarantee of the harmonious co-existence between
                Greeks and Turks. Without discriminating on grounds of race or
                religion, Chrysanthos extended his social action to the care of
                thousands of refugees (Christians, Muslims, Armenian   orphans)

                financial assistance for the Pontians of Russia from the Russian
                government. As leader of the Pontic Greeks, his prestige
                increased when, in July of 1917, Grand Duke Nikolay,
                contemplating the repercussions of a prolonged Russo-Turkish
                war, asked him to approach the Turkish government and recommend
                that it make peace, an effort which unfortunately was not
                successful.

                In 1918, the truce that ended World War I gave new hope to the
                Greeks of Pontos. They believed that the promises of the allies
                and the declaration of the US President Wilson about the
                self-determination of the peoples would be carried out. Early in
                1919, Chrysanthos traveled to Paris as one of a three-member
                delegation consisting of the vicar of the Ecumenical Throne
                Metropolitan Dorotheos of Prusa, Alexandras Papas and himself.
                This mission represented the Greeks of Asia Minor at the peace
                conference.

                In 1920, he traveled to Tbilisi in Georgia, working to
                re-establish the auto cephalous Orthodox Church there. From
                Tbilisi he went to Yerevan, capital of the newly constituted
                Armenian Republic, where he negotiated the creation of a Ponto
                &#8211; Armenian Federation. Upon his return, he not unnaturally
                faced the wrath of the Turks and sought refuge, for
                safety&#8217;s sake, in Constantinople, then under Allied
                occupation. On 20 September 1921, he was condemned to death in
                absentia by the Kemalist Independence Court, which after summary
                proceedings had already sent 69 Greek notables from Amisos and
                other regions to the gallows. In 1922, the Prelate was obliged
                to flee from Constantinople, as it had been abandoned by the
                Allies, and to establish himself in Athens, where in 1926 he was
                appointed accredited representative of the Ecumenical
                Patriarchate. His knowledge of ecclesiastical matters, his broad
                learning, his ethos and refusal to dabble in politics (&#8220;by
                nature and education I abstain from any involvement in petty
                politics&#8230;&#8221;) were appreciated by the Greek
                government, which entrusted him with a number of missions.
                Albania (1927), Belgrade, Bucharest, Warsaw (1929), Mount Athos
                (1929, 1920, 1935) and Cyprus (1931) were just a few of his
                successful efforts to settle matters arising in the Churches
                outside Greece.

                From 1928 until his death in 1949, Chrysanthos served as
                chairman of the Committee of Pontic Studies, and was a founding
                member of the internationally acclaimed scholarly journal
                Archeion Pontou (1928), which is still being published to this
                day.

                />In December of 1938, he was elected Archbishop of Athens and
                All Greece. During his brief pastorate as archbishop, he had an
                opportunity to demonstrate the full range of his administrative
                abilities and the virtues of a true religious leader. When the
                Click to enlargeItalians attacked Greece, causing a multitude of
                young Greek soldiers to be sent to the mountains of Albania, he
                reacted as though he were still metro­politan of Trebizond,
                entrusted with the sacred duty of saving or at least relieving
                his flock. He organized &#8220;Welfare of Enlisted Men&#8221;,
                collected and sent significant financial help to the families of
                enlisted men; he visited the wounded, and sent packages to the
                front. A flurry of events followed. Anthimos A. Papadopoulos
                reports:
              </p>
              <p>
                On the ill-starred day of 27 April 1941, the vanguard of the
                Germans arrived in Ambelokipi [district of Athens]. As  early
                as   the  24th  of the   month [Chrysanthos]had been called to
                serve as chairman of a committee that would hand the city
                officially over to the Germans. But the Prelate refused saying:
                &#8220;The Archbishop does not agree to take part in the
                committee to surrender the city to the enemy, the work of the
                Archbishop is not to submit, but to liberate.&#8221; How could
                this prelate whose enthronement speech as metropolitan of
                Trebizond had proclaimed: &#8220;I prefer flying as an eagle to
                fall, rather than crawling, to live&#8221; &#8211; have done
                otherwise?
              </p>
              <p>
                At the Diocese Synod, he stood up to receive General von
                Stummer, commander of the second army corps, whom he asked
                directly why Germany declared war on Greece. And of course, he
                refused to swear in the collaborationist government: &#8220;What
                kind of government are you? Constitutional? No, because you do
                not have the mandate of the king. Revolutionary? But you are not
                that either&#8230; You are a government imposed by foreign
                invaders&#8230;&#8221;
              </p>
              <p>
                Chrysanthos was dismissed from his post on 2 July 1941 and
                withdrew to a little house in the Kypseli district of Athens,
                which upon his request, was renamed Soumela St. Throughout the
                German occupation he did not take a single step outside this
                house. Penniless, he was sustained by the generosity of his
                friends. It would be a grave omission to overlook his election
                on 28 November 1939 as a member of the Academy of Athens. The
                enormous volume of his writings, including articles in
                Ekklesiastiki Alitheia, the periodical Komninitis Trapezountos
                and other publications, his edition of two speeches by Bessarion
                from the National Marcian Library in Venice, but primarily his
                monumental 900-page work about the Church of Trebizond that was
                published as a series in Archeion Pontou by the Committee of
                Pontic Studies, indicate the magnitude of his intellectual
                contribution. He was awarded an honor arydoctorate by the
                University of Athens School of Theology for his learning and
                exceptional ethos. The speech he made on the subject &#8220;The
                Church and culture in our East&#8221; at his official reception
                by the Academy of Athens on10 February 1940 was his first paper
                as an Academician. It was a significant study that captured the
                Prelate&#8217;s breadth of spirit in accepting both the role of
                the ancient Greek tradition and of the Church in &#8220;our
                East&#8221;. &#8220;Orthodox Greek Christianity absorbs
                everything the East has in terms of passion, strength and
                enthusiasm; the Church, under the influence of the Hellenic
                spirit, tames and embellishes and distinguishes the unformed
                depth of soul and life and art of the peoples of the East in the
                ethereal pure and merry lines and forms of the Greek soul and
                life and art&#8230;&#8221;

                />After the German occupation had ended, the prelate did not
                seek to return to the archbishop&#8217;s throne, so as not to
                create internal irregularities and discord. Besides, the
                attitude of state and Church alike, from the period of his
                withdrawal up to his death, was completely indifferent. Just a
                month before his death, on 28 September 1949, the Holy Synod
                recognized Chrysanthos as the former Archbishop of Athens
                (&#8220;with ecclesiastical frugality&#8221;) in order to offer
                him some rudimentary financial support. His desire to
                &#8220;have the plain unofficial funeral of someone who was just
                an ordinary priest&#8221; had been expressed orally to Georgios
                N. Tasoudis. But his last wishes were not observed, on the
                grounds that &#8220;Chrysanthos did not belong to his family,
                but to the Click to enlargeNation and the Church&#8221;. Thus he
                was given an official funeral with the honors of an archbishop,
                awarded the Grand Cross medal. An irony of fate? The rendering
                &#8211; albeit at the last possible moment &#8211; of justice?
                Whatever we may hypothesize, the fact is that it would have been
                inappropriate to respect the last wishes of a man who had
                offered his entire life to fulfilling his obligations to his
                congregation, to his country, to the idea of Freedom, and to the
                reconciliation of peoples. When his will, in which he disposed
                of his few possessions, was opened, the following codicil was
                also read:
              </p>
              <p>
                &#8220;When the Lord is pleased to call me from here, I ask that
                my funeral be held in a closed circle and with just one priest
                [&#8230;].I request that this wish be applied faithfully and
                accurately. In Athens, 25 November 1941. Chrysanthos of
