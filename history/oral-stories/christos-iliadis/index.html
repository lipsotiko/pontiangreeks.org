                <strong>CHRISTOS ILIADIS</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I was born during 1911, in the village Ahurnu, south of Ordu, in
                the Black Sea region. I had nine brothers and sisters. My
                father&#8217;s name was Panagiotis and my mother was
                named Pelagia.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the tragic moment came, they gathered all the Christians of
                our area. I was only five years old at the time and cannot
                remember much more.  All I recall is that only my sister Evropi
                and I survived; the rest of my family perished.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the women in our village, followed the Gendarmes that
                night, while all the men were exiled. Through their tears and
                sobbing, these women tried to elicit the sympathy of the
                gendarmes and the soldiers who monitored the deportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                When night came, the cries of children from each home could be
                heard out on the streets. Even the yelping dogs could sense the
                evil occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our home that night, there were only six children. My four
                sisters and my brother Haralampos who was not older than
                fifteen. I was only five years old. We agonized over the return
                of our friends, relatives, and neighbors. In vain, our poor
                mother followed the route of exile taken by my father and her
                older sons.
              </p>
              <p>
                All women abandoned their search, and returned home, desperate
                and dying from marching in the cold weather. Our mother also
                returned alone. One hour later, she was dead. Her death left six
                orphans abandoned and unprotected.  I was too young at the time
                to fully understand the loss of my mother.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our village was destroyed. No men remained. Everyone had gone on
                foot to the city of Ordu. Without any support, or protection, we
                also took the road to Ordu, which offered greater safety. We
                embarked on this destination on the advice given by our church.
                Thank God, the people of Ordu helped us. They provided us with
                shelter and food.
              </p>
              <p>
                Soon after, we faced a new calamity. Turkish police arrived and
                they gathered all females over the age of fifteen, kidnapping my
                three sisters. Now only the three of us children remained in
                Ordu.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much time had passed and we heard no news about the girls.
                Later, some people said that the Turkish policemen sexually
                abused them all and then threw them down the cliff. Only God
                knows what really happened. Many Christian families in Ordu
                adopted the orphans. My brother was adopted by a family called
                Grigoriadu. My sister was adopted by a family called
                Semertzidis.  By now, I had turned 6 years old.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also adopted by a family but after three days they threw
                me out on the street, leaving me at God&#8217;s mercy, because I
                was very weak and they were afraid I might get sick. All
                children like me, who were not accepted into households with
                families, were instead placed in an orphanage administered by
                the rich Christians of Ordu. The school building next to
                IPAPANTI Church, became our orphanage
              </p>
              <p>
                One day in 1916, or 1917, I do not remember the exact date, the
                Russian fleet of the Black Sea, appeared in Ordu. The Turkish
                population of Ordu ran away to the mountains because there were
                great rumors that many Armenians were serving within the Russian
                army vessels. The Russians brought boats to the coast and
                gathered Christians on their fleet to be transferred to Russia.
                The teachers and personnel of our orphanage ran out to the sea,
                leaving behind the crying orphans.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then left our orphanage and ran towards the sea coast, to
                save ourselves by boarding the Russian boats. I was six and a
                half years old and I found myself responsible for my own
                survival. I managed to enter a small boat which exceeded
                capacity and could not depart from the coast. My brother and my
                sister left with their new parents to Russia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I realized it, I was thrown out of the boat. A man threw
                me out and the only thing I could to at that moment was cry.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the Russian fleet left, the Turkish police returned to
                Ordu. They were evicting the residents from their homes. They
                also came to our orphanage to find 100 of us. They were very
                angry as they forced us outside. They informed us of their new
                plan in which we were to be transported away from the coast.  We
                were then exiled &#8211; memories of which, can bring shivers to
                one’s spine. From this exile, I only remember a two month
                martyr’s march. 2,500 souls departed Ordu and by the end of this
                ordeal, only 1,350 skeletons, resembling human beings, remained.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of us were taken to Erbaa, others to Tokat. We were kept
                alive with a little bread and some olives.
              </p>
              <p>
                One morning, they told us we could return to Ordu. I was very
                glad to hear of this, not expecting to find a deserted city.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Patriarch took care of our arrival in Constantinople. We all
                had tears in our eyes as we bid a final farewell to our beloved
                homeland. In Constantinople we were brought to an orphanage
                located on one of the islands on the Sea of Marmama. There were
                700 orphans from several regions. They cut our hair, gave us a
                bath along with clean clothes and shoes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was here where I took my first school lessons. There were
                some American ladies who also brought us some gifts. It was at
                that time when I received the first gift of my life, a small
                ball, which I kept like a talisman. One day a picnic was also
                organized for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                We stayed in that orphanage for about four years and were then
                taken to Greece. The orphans were relocated to several
                orphanages around the country. I finally entered the Naval
                School for officers in the island of Poros.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the holidays came, any of my classmates who had a mother or
                other relatives, received permission to leave school and visit
                their families. Those of us had nobody else on earth, had to
                stay at school. I will never in my life forget the feelings of
                joy, when our classmates returned from vacations and brought
                some gifts to me saying: “Take it. This gift is from my mother
                to you”. My eyes were full of tears knowing that there were
                still somebody in the world who cared about me.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left">
                I graduated from the naval school and served on the Greek Naval
                Fleet for thirty seven years. Now, at the end of my life, I am
                glad to be a grandfather and I thank God that everyting came to
                a good conclusion
